**First enter your current password and then enter a new password and confirm the new password. The same validation rules apply as when creating a new account.**

**The New** Password must be between eight and 40 characters. 

If all fields are valid you'll be returned to the [Dashboard](../)

You can exit this screen at any time by clicking on the X at the top right of the screen.
