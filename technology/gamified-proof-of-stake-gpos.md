# Gamified Proof of Stake \(GPOS\)

Building on the success of the DPOS consensus mechanism, Peerplays introduced a unique enhancement called Gamified Proof of Stake \(GPOS\). This idea was first proposed as Peerplays Improvement Proposal \(PIP\) \#2 in 

The original intent of Peerplays was to operate as a Decentralized Autonomous Cooperative \(DAC\) where DPOS enables the voting collective of core token holders to determine who would act as Advisors, Witness, and Proposals within Peerplays. However, the challenges of voter turnout continue to plague Peerplays like other DPOS based blockchains. 

GPOS made a protocol change such that PPY token holders now receive a 'participation reward' based on their voting performance and how many PPY they have vested or 'staked'.

This is a significant change from the original protocol where token holders were rewarded with their share of a "rake', taken from a percentage of the blockchain fees, and then distributed to token holders relative to their token holdings, regardless of any voting participation.

Being a DPOS consensus blockchain, the importance of voter participation of the PPY token holders is paramount to the security of the blockchain. The introduction of GPOS ensures that token holders will take an active interest in the operation and governance of Peerplays.
