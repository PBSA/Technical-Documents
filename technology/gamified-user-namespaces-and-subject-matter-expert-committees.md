# Gamified User Namespaces and Subject Matter Expert Committees

## 1. Gamified User Namespaces

SPK network, a Peerplays community, will have its own namespace when users register that will always end with `.SPK`. Under this authority, dapp protocols will automatically whitelist these users for various operations relating to community governance. The gamified user namespace \(GUN\) will provide a means of onboarding new user accounts at little to no cost and will gamify the process of becoming a full user.

1. Registration &gt; `randomname.SPK` - keys \(no fee\)
2. Deposit Funds &gt; option to choose `username.SPK` \(fee set by a Subject Matter Expert Committee, or SMEC\)
3. Engagement via Rewards Engine Parameter &gt; option to choose `username.SPK`  \(fee set by SMEC\)

The user accounts that operate under `.SPK` will have special switches which are associated with SPK network SMEC which will allow them to be able to vote on the rate of fees for operations. Before voting these operations will be whatever the current rate on Peerplays stands. Voting capabilities will be available only to the holders of SPK-NFTs, BRONCA-NFTs, or LARNIX-NFTs depending on what works best for the SPK network.

There will be many random sources which will be shared for account registration due to the faucets being built into network infrastructure nodes.

## 2. SKP Network NFTs Backed by Liquid Staking

SPK-NFTs are created by staking SPK and will have the capability to lock for up to 10 years \(can be longer if set in the token parameters\). If no period is selected they will, by default, stay locked with an inverse time to withdraw. This means if they stay locked for 30 days, it would take 30 days to withdraw if they initiated this on the 30th day to get their SPK out of the NFT. The NFT is then burned.

An alternative to destroying the NFTs would be to sell them on the NFT Marketplace and get access to their SPK or any other asset they want to sell it for instantly without the SPK needing to be unlocked from the NFT for whatever staking period may have been selected.

The staked SPK goes into the SPK Liquidity Pool with AMM DEX to power liquidity in SPK markets. The SPK market fees then flow back to all the SPK-NFT holders proportionally. The SPK-NFT that gets issued will have a PowerUP rating associated with the amount of SPK that was used to stake into the NFT. This gets used as the measure for rewards they receive. This means that the longer term someone commits to the staking period, the greater the rewards they will receive. When rewards are paid out they must be claimed by the user account and can be in the asset of their choosing supported in Peerplays. This means they could get SPK, BTC, PPY, HIVE, or any other assets available. If this is not desired, limited options can be made available in user interfaces.

These NFTs will be governed by dynamic properties while at the same time being capable of having custom "skins" for users preferences which can have additional gamification benefits.

## 3. Subject Matter Expert Committees \(SMECs\)

Based on the SPK-NFT PowerUP, the user will be able to cast voting in various matters relating to the network.

Voting power is determined by the length of time the NFT has existed and the staked length. A linear scale starting from zero to the period staked provides that amount of weight multiplier the voter carries. This means someone who stakes for 10 years will not get the full weight multiplier on their stake, but instead will have it added to their account over the period of the stake with each coinday. Likewise, someone who has decided to stake by default with accumulating locking will experience the same multiplier effect over time. However, the staker of 10 years will have their weight increase from day one, as their multiplier has been predetermined by the 10 year commit.

This ensures that long term actors are the ones who will be able to carry more influence, but they will only have that influence accumulate over time. The only way for new people to gain this added vote power would be to accumulate SPK-NFTs from the marketplace which have been aged, thus increasing the subjective value of the SPK-NFTs.

Using the SPK-NFT the user can vote on the parameters of the network to determine what rates should be paid for fees on various operations. Some operations may be the rewards earned for holding SPK-NFTs that are generated from the DEX/AMM Liquidity Pools. These come from parameters set in the SPK market which will only be able to be controlled via voting among `username.SPK` accounts, and SPK-NFTs.

Another element which `username.SPK` users will be able to use are the operations of the SMEC which enables the users to vote for a committee of members which can be funded through various mechanisms. The SMEC do not have direct access to the funding pool but instead must approve proposals which should be used for their mission intent. Effectively the SMEC acts as a manager, and the ones who are doing the work are being paid by the proposal. Payouts for the funds only occur monthly when the SMEC publishes a progress report on the activity so as to provide concise communication feedback to the community at large.

Multiple SMECs can be created by the `username.SPK` community for any number of reasons beyond just funded work. Typically SMECs might include, but are not limited to, marketing, sales, development, legal, and payment gateways. The `SPK.SMEC` could also be configured so that the SPK market fees can flow to the `SPK.SMEC` for funding.
