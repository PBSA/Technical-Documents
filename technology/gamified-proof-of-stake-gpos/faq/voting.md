# Voting

### What happens if I don't vote?

Simply put, you'll lose a percentage of your qualifying rewards for every month that you don't vote. If after six months you still haven't voted you won't qualify for any participation rewards.

### Will my voting performance go back to 100% once I vote?

Yes, regardless of your level of voting performance as soon as you vote it'll return to 100%. It will however, start to decay again if you don't vote regularly.

Can I just vote for s proxy and then let them manage my account.

Yes, this is the role of the proxy ... but if you do this make sure your proxy is reliable s your voting performance is in their hands!
