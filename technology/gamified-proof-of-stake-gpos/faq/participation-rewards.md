# Participation Rewards

### How are participation rewards different from traditional dividend distributions?

GPOS introduces a number of significant changes to the old method of dividing the Peerplays rake between all token holders relative to how many tokens they hold.

The biggest change is that the percentage of the rake is based on the total of all **GPOS vested balances**, and not the cumulative value of all PPY in circulation. This gives the opportunity for regular voters to get a larger share of the rake than before by virtue of other unreliable voters.

### I'm confused, just how exactly are my rewards calculated?

At first the new formula for calculating your estimated reward percentage can be a bit confusing; this example should help:

If you have a GPOS balance of 1,000PPY, and have voted recently so you have qualified for a 100%, reward and the total GPOS balance on the blockchain is 4,000,000PPY when the rake is distributed, then your percentage of the rake would be:



GPOS balance = b  
Total GPOS balance on blockchain = TB  
Qualified reward % = q

Estimated Rake Reward% = \(b / TB\) \* q

**For example:**

A user has a GPOS balance of 1,000PPY and is entitled to 100% of their reward based on voting performance. The total GPOS balance on the blockchain is 4,000,000PPY.

The user would receive the following percentage of the rake:

\(1,000 / 4,000,000\) \* 100% = 0.025%

So if the total \(month\) rake was 100,000PPY then the user would receive 25PPY.
