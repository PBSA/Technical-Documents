# Power Up

After clicking on the `Power Up` button from the [GPOS landing page](gpos-landing-page.md) you'll be taken to the Power Up screen from where you can vest towards your GPOS balance.

The functionality of this screen is very straightforward. Simply select an amount of PPY to vest by either entering it in the Deposit field, or scroll the amount up and down using the `+` and `-` buttons.

**Important**: You might think you can vest 100% of your PPY balance to get the maximum participation rewards. However each time you perform an operation on the blockchain there is always a 0.002PPY transaction fee. This means that you must leave at least this amount in your balance in order to perform the Power Up.
