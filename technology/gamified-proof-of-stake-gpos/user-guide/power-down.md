# Power Down

After clicking on the `Power Down` button on the [GPOS landing page](gpos-landing-page.md) you'll be taken to the Power Down screen from where you can withdraw from your GPOS balance.

Unsurprisingly the Power Down screen follows a very similar format to [Power Up](power-up.md); you just use it to withdraw from your GPOS balance, instead of adding to it.

Just like the [Power Up](power-up.md) screen you can select an amount by scrolling up and down using the `+` and `-` buttons. The amount you select will be shown in the Withdraw field and reflected in your New GPOS Balance as well.

You can withdraw up to the total of your Opening GPOS Balance.

**Note**: There is a transaction fee of 0.01PPY each time a withdrawal is done.
{% endhint %}

In the example above the user has no vested balance. If an amount of 80PPY is vested the New GPOS Balance will be 80PPY and if the user power's up again the Opening GPOS Balance will be 80PPY as will the New GPOS Balance.

### GPOS Balance holding Period

In the example above note that although the Opening GPOS Balance is 80PPY the Available GPOS Balance is zero. This is because there is a 30 day holding period on new deposits. In the example above the deposit was made the same day as the requested withdrawal.

The main reasons for having a holding period are:

* It's in your best interest to maintain a GPOS balance, withdrawing from the balance will effect your participation rewards.
* Withdrawing all the balance before 30 days could also effect your reward percentage by not allowing you to vote.
