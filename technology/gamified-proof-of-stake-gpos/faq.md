### What is GPOS?

GPOS is short for Gamified Proof of Stake which is an advanced implementation of the DPOS consensus mechanism.

GPOS gives voting weight and rewards to all token holders that commit some of their PPY balance as a vested GPOS balance. For more information see [Gamified Proof of Stake](./).
