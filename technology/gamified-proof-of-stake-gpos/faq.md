### What is GPOS?

GPOS is short for Gamified Proof of Stake which is an advanced implementation of the DPOS consensus mechanism.

GPOS gives voting weight and rewards to all token holders that commit some of their PPY balance as a vested GPOS balance. For more information see [Gamified Proof of Stake](./).

### What is a vested balance?

The best way to understand this is to compare it to the difference between stock options and shares. If you hold stock options you have a stake in the company, but the options have no value unless you can profit from them and to do this the options have to first be vested as shares.

GPOS works the same way, instead of all token holders being entitled to dividends just by virtue of holding tokens \(shares\), token holders now have a PPY balance \(options\) that they only profit from when they are vested in GPOS \(become shares\).

### What is in it for me?

Well, actually a lot! 

Your active participation in the governance of the blockchain will strengthen the democratic process and make the operators of Peerplays much more accountable. Not only do you have the opportunity to earn maximum dividends as before, but if you are a diligent voter you can also profit from the token holders that aren't as reliable.

### What happens if I don't vote?

Simply put, you'll lose a percentage of your qualifying rewards for every month that you don't vote. If after six months you still haven't voted you won't qualify for any participation rewards.
