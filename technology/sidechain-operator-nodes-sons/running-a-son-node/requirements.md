| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 8 Cores | 64GB | 300GB SSD | 1Gbps | Ubuntu 18.04 |

> These requirements are as of the time of writing, so consider deploying a server with specs slightly higher than the ones listed above in order to "future proof" your server in case the minimum requirements grow in the future.
