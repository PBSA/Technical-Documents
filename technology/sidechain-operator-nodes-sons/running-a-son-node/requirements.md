## System Requirements

The following table lists what should be considered the minimum system requirements for running a son node:

| CPU | Memory | Storage | Bandwidth | OS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 8 Cores | 64GB | 300GB SSD | 1Gbps | Ubuntu 18.04 |

These requirements are as of the time of writing, so consider deploying a server with specs slightly higher than the ones listed above in order to "future proof" your server in case the minimum requirements grow in the future.
