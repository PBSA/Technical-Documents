# Peerplays SONs

Bitcoin and Ethereum are slow, expensive to use, and not scalable enough for mass adoption and usability. They can’t support high transaction throughput.

SONs provide an alternative way for blockchains to communicate with each other, which opens up new possibilities in terms of scalability and interoperability.

Peerplays SONs are decentralized, trustless, and elective. The side chains are as secure as they can get. They can keep the scalability trilemma at bay (security, decentralization, and scalability).

Public open decentralized blockchains are the way to go forward. We here at Peerplays are committed to make sure whatever we create is not centralized and can’t be manipulated.
