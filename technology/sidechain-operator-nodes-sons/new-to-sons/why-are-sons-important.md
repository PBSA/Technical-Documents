# Why are SONs important?

SONs help the blockchains scale and develop more quickly. Blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum have to validate every new transaction on their own. But SONS only have to periodically refresh information from the root chain with updates about transactions. Which means massive scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization!

The problem with blockchains out there that offer inter-blockchain communications like Cosmos and Polkadot is that they ‘talk’ only with other blockchains that are identical like them. This doesn’t really solve the problem of blockchains interacting with one another. It creates a situation where a ‘foreign’ blockchain must switch over to another blockchain that is able to communicate with a blockchain that is ‘compatible’ with Polkadot or Cosmos.

That’s why Peerplays SONs technology is an innovative, elegant solution.
