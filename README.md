# Introduction to Peerplays

The code for this documentation portal is on [GitHub](https://github.com/PBSA/Technical-Documents/blob/master/README.md) and we would welcome all contributions from the community.

## What is Peerplays?

Peerplays is the first decentralized global betting platform, disrupting the global gaming industry with a new paradigm of fairness, transparency, speed, and security. 

Peerplays removes the need for third-party betting operators, using Graphene technology and Delegated Proof of Stake \(DPoS\) to provide the fastest, most decentralized blockchain consensus model available today.

## Why Peerplays?

Peerplays is building an ecosystem of betting products and apps, offering online bettors a real alternative to secretive and unfair third-party betting operators.

The Peerplays blockchain is a game-changer for bettors around the world:

1. **Provably Fair** – Every Peerplays software component has been designed to provide a fair gaming experience. And, unlike with traditional betting operators, all Peerplays software is open-source and publicly audit-able. Peerplays sets new standards for provably-fair gaming.
2. **100% Real-Time Transparency** – Peerplays publicly broadcasts each transaction as it is executed on the blockchain in real-time. As soon as a bet is placed, anyone can view the full audit trail of that bet, marking a step-change in betting-industry standards for transparency.
3. **Fast, Secure, Anonymous Control** – Peerplays integrates with all digital currencies \(Bitcoin, ETH, etc\) to provide bettors with fast, cryptographically-secured deposits and withdrawals, immediate access to funds, and anonymous control over each and every transaction.
4. **Most Trusted** – Peerplays uses DPoS to create a fully decentralized betting blockchain. This removes third party betting operators from the equation \(traditional sportsbooks and betting exchanges\) creating a completely independent platform where 100% trust is built into the core technology. \(In the same way, Bitcoin released money from the control of third party financial institutions\).
5. **Most Reliable** – Graphene technology gives Peerplays financial markets-grade performance and reliability with years of successful deployment logged via the BitShares blockchain.
6. **Global** – With witness nodes spread across the world, and the capacity to process over 10,000 transactions per second, the Peerplays blockchain scales to deliver a truly global betting platform

## Who is Behind Peerplays?

A number of different groups and individuals share jurisdiction over the Peerplays blockchain, which ensures no single entity can gain control over the database. These groups and individuals include Witnesses, Advisors, and PPY token holders. For more information on the governance of the Peerplays blockchain, please visit the [Governance section](https://www.peerplays.com/governance/) of the website.

The Peerplays blockchain software has been developed by the Peerplays Blockchain Standards Association \(PBSA\), a non-profit organization based in Canada. For more information on PBSA, please visit [pbsa.info](http://www.pbsa.info/).
