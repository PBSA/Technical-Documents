# GitLab Artifact Install

This document assumes that you are running Ubuntu 18.04.

The following steps outline the artifact installation of a Witness Node:

1. Prepare the environment
2. Download and extract the artifacts
3. Copy the artifacts to the proper locations
4. Update the `config.ini` File
5. Create a Peerplays Account
6. Update `config.ini` with Witness Account Info
7. Start the Witness and Vote for Yourself
8. Auto-Starting the Witness Node

## 1. Prepare the environment

### 1.1. Hardware requirements

Please see the general Witness [hardware requirements](https://app.gitbook.com/@peerplays/s/documents/witnesses/witness-node-hardware-requirements).

For the GitLab artifact install, the requirements that we'll need for this guide would be as follows:

| Node Type? | CPU | Memory | Storage | Bandwidth | OS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Witness | 4 Cores | 16GB | 100GB SSD | 1Gbps | Ubuntu 18.04 |

{% hint style="warning" %}
The artifacts from GitLab are already built for x86\_64 architecture. These will not work with ARM based architecture.
{% endhint %}

### 1.2. Install the dependencies

The following dependencies are necessary for a clean install of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:

```text
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y  install libzmq3-dev wget zip unzip
```

## 2. Download and extract the artifacts

Artifacts are pre-built binaries that are available to download from GitLab. You can see the available pipelines, sorted by release tags, on the GitLab [Peerplays project](https://gitlab.com/PBSA/peerplays/-/pipelines?scope=tags&page=1) page. The link in the code below refers to release tag `1.5.11` which is the latest production release as of the writing of this document. Please make sure to replace the tag with the one you need. The test releases are available as well, `test-1.5.5` for example.

```text
cd /home/ubuntu
mkdir artifacts
cd artifacts
sudo wget https://gitlab.com/PBSA/peerplays/-/jobs/artifacts/1.5.11/download?job=build -O artifacts.zip
unzip artifacts.zip
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Double check the tag in the download link!
{% endhint %}

## 3. Copy the artifacts to the proper locations

Putting the `witness_node` and `cli_wallet` programs in the `/usr/local/bin` directory will allow us to call the program from any directory.

```text
sudo cp /home/ubuntu/artifacts/build/programs/witness_node/witness_node /usr/local/bin/witness_node
sudo cp /home/ubuntu/artifacts/build/programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet /usr/local/bin/cli_wallet
```

Now we can run start the node with:

```text
witness_node
```

Launching the witness creates the required directories which contain the config.ini file we'll need to edit. We'll stop the witness now with `Ctrl + C` so we can edit the config file.

## 4. Edit the config.ini file

We need to set the endpoint and seed-node addresses so we can access the cli\_wallet and download all the initial blocks from the chain. Within the config.ini file, locate the p2p-endpoint, rpc-endpoint, and seed-node settings and enter the following addresses.

```text
nano ~/witness_node_data_dir/config.ini

p2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:9777
rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:8090
seed-node = 213.184.255.234:59500
```

Save the changes and start the Witness back up.

```text
witness_node
```

## 5. Create a Peerplays Account

We'll need an account as the basis of creating a new Witness. The easiest way to do that is to use the GUI wallet.

### 5.1. Download the Peerplays Core GUI Wallet to Make an Account

[Peerplays Core GUI](https://github.com/peerplays-network/peerplays-core-gui/releases)

1. Install, open, and create an account. It's pretty self-explanatory. ðŸ™‚ 
2. Wait for your node to sync the blocks \(about 7.3GB at the time of writing\). We need to do this before we can use the CLI wallet.
3. From this point on, please note the results of the following commands as you'll need them later.

### 5.2. Use the cli\_wallet to set a password and unlock the wallet

Back in a **new** command line window, we can access the cli\_wallet program after all the blocks have been downloaded from the chain. Note that "your-password-here" is a password that you're creating for the cli\_wallet and doesn't necessarily have to be the password you used in the GUI wallet earlier.

```text
cli_wallet
set_password your-password-here
unlock your-password-here
```

The CLI wallet will show `unlocked >>>` when successfully unlocked.

{% hint style="info" %}
A list of CLI wallet commands is available here: [https://www.peerplays.tech/api/peerplays-wallet-api/wallet-calls](https://www.peerplays.tech/api/peerplays-wallet-api/wallet-calls)
{% endhint %}

### 5.3. Generate OWNER private keys for the cli\_wallet and import them

This will return an array with your owner key in the form of `["PPYxxx", "xxxx"]`. Note that the "created-username" and "created-password" used here are the username and password from the GUI wallet!

```text
get_private_key_from_password created-username owner created-password
```

The second value in the returned array is the private key of your owner key. Now we'll import that into the cli\_wallet.

```text
import_key "created-username" SECONDVALUEFROMLASTCOMMAND
```

### 5.4. Generate ACTIVE private keys for the cli\_wallet and import them

Once again, this will return an array with your active key in the form of `["PPYxxx", "xxxx"]`. Note that the "created-username" and "created-password" used here are the username and password from the GUI wallet!

```text
get_private_key_from_password created-username active created-password
```

The second value in the returned array is the private key of your active key. Now we'll import that into the cli\_wallet.

```text
import_key "created-username" SECONDVALUEFROMLASTCOMMAND
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The keys that begin with "PPY" are the public keys.
{% endhint %}

### 5.5. Upgrade to lifetime membership

You will need some PPY for this command to succeed. The account must have lifetime membership status to create a new Witness.

```text
upgrade_account created-username true
```

### 5.6. Create yourself as a Witness

The URL in this command is your own URL which should point to a page which describes who you are and why you want to become a Peerplays witness. Note your block signing key after you enter this command.

This command will require some PPY as well.

```text
create_witness created-username "https://your-url-to-witness-proposal" true
```

### 5.7. Gather your Witness account info

First we'll get the private key for your block\_signing\_key.

```text
get_private_key YOURBLOCKSIGNINGKEY
```

Then dump your keys to check and compare. One of the returned values from the following command should match your block\_signing\_key.

```text
dump_private_keys
```

Last we'll get your witness ID.

```text
get_witness created-username
```

## 6. Edit config.ini to include your Witness ID and your private key pair

Exit the cli\_wallet with the `quit` command. We'll stop the Witness \(`Ctrl + C` in the first command line window\) and edit the `config.ini` file once again.

```text
nano ~/witness_node_data_dir/config.ini

witness-id = "your_witness_id"
private-key = ["block_signing_key", "private_key_for_your_block_signing_key"]
```

## 7. Start the Witness and vote for yourself

```text
witness_node
```

Once again, we need to wait for the node to sync the blocks to use the cli\_wallet. After the sync, you can vote for yourself. Back in the second command line window:

```text
cli_wallet
unlock your-password-here
vote_for_witness created-username created-username true true
```

Now you can check your votes to verify it worked.

```text
get_witness your_witness_account
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Congrats! You've successfully installed your Witness node using GitLab artifacts! ðŸŽŠ 
{% endhint %}

## 8. What's Next?

### 8.1. Auto-starting your node

Up until this point we have been running the node in the foreground which is fragile and inconvenient. So let's start the node as a service when the system boots up instead.

{% page-ref page="../../the-basics/auto-starting-a-node.md" %}

### 8.2. Creating a backup node

After that, it would be smart to create a backup server to enable you to make software updates, troubleshoot issues with the node, and otherwise take your node offline without causing service outages.

{% page-ref page="../../the-basics/backup-servers.md" %}

### 8.3. Join the Testnet \(Beatrice\)

As we all know, testing should never be done in production. This is why all node operators must also participate in the public testnet, Beatrice.

{% page-ref page="../../the-basics/joining-the-public-testnet.md" %}

### 8.4. Fire up another node ðŸ”¥ 

You've got a Witness node. Now you'll need a BOS node. And since you're in the node making mood, how about a SON too?

### 8.5. Enable SSL to encrypt your node traffic

If you have a node that is accessible from the internet \(for example, an API or Seed node\) it would be wise to enable SSL connections to your node.

{% page-ref page="../../advanced-topics/reverse-proxy-for-enabling-ssl.md" %}

## 9. Glossary

**Witness:** An independent server operator which validates network transactions.

**Witness Node:** Nodes with a closed RPC port. They don't allow external connections. Instead these nodes focus on processing transactions into blocks.
