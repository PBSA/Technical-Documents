# Updating a Witness Node

There will be many occasions when a node has to be updated with new code. These software updates can be broken down as "soft forks' or "hard forks". 

#### Soft Fork

A soft fork is a software update that is compatible with earlier versions, in other words it’s backward compatible. A soft fork contains no new operation or updates to existing operations on the blockchain.

Generally a soft fork 

A “hard fork” is a software update that isn’t backwards compatible, so any blocks coming after the activation of the software update will have to follow the new rules in order to be considered valid.
