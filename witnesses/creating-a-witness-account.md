# Obtaining private keys for cli\_wallet



#### 

#### 3. Using password generated in GUI wallet in _cli\_wallet_

In the Graphene based blockchains like Peerplays the hierarchical permissions like fund transfer, sending memo etc are separated using different roles and Public-Private key-pairs for each role. We have 3 types of roles OWNER, ACTIVE and MEMO. These keys are generated using a brain key.

The password auto generated by the wallet is a brain key. And the brain key is used to generate various key-pairs in the Wallet Import Format \(WIF\).

{% hint style="info" %}
_**WIF = SHA256\( username + role + brain key\)**_

example:

OWNER WIF = SHA256\(peerplays user name + owner + brain key\)
{% endhint %}

![\(New account in Peerplays wallet\)](../.gitbook/assets/image.webp)

The above brain key belongs to the user _t3st123_

Note that the above password is not the private or public key. So we need to create the key pairs to be used in the `cli_wallet` using the method `get_private_key_from_password`

* To generate the OWNER keypair, use the following command

```cpp
get_private_key_from_password t3st123 owner RAjoOuuSX9N2semIlQOM52iHCQMUrDZPqnpPUDZNpMu2HSYj1gQi
```

**Result:**

_unlocked &gt;&gt;&gt; get\_private\_key\_from\_password t3st123 owner RAjoOuuSX9N2semIlQOM52iHCQMUrDZPqnpPUDZNpMu2HSYj1gQi get\_private\_key\_from\_password t3st123 owner RAjoOuuSX9N2semIlQOM52iHCQMUrDZPqnpPUDZNpMu2HSYj1gQi \[ "PPY5xmkfRJhsG54kxNpoBtWqnEpScGBxczooapTbCpmetFAmzUvJ1", "5KPHKeuqRyNfuc32LGDzc6tqcCPzyLgfguQzN4Xkrys3VfMxtjB" \]_

ACTIVE & MEMO keys also can be obtained in the same way.
