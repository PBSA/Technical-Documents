# Becoming a Peerplays Witness

Congratulations! You’ve taken the first step towards becoming a Peerplays Witness.

### **Can anyone be a Peerplays Witness?**

Yes, anybody can become a Peerplays Witness, but first ask yourself how you would answer the following questions:

1. Explain the role of a Peerplays Witness. 
2. Why do you want to be a Witness?
3. What qualities would you bring to the Peerplays community?
4. How much time are you willing to set aside to fulfil your obligations?
5. What do you know about the Bookie Oracle System \(BOS\)?
6. Do you have any experience as a server administrator?
7. Do you understand the costs associated with buying and running the necessary hardware to be a witness node operator?

If you can answer these questions you’re well on your way to becoming a witness.

So yes, anybody could become a Peerplays Witness, but only those special few will become Witnesses.

### **The duties of a Peerplays Witness**

The primary duty of Peerplays Witnesses is to bundle transactions into blocks and sign them with their signing key. Witnesses keep the blockchain alive by producing one block every three seconds. For example, if there were 20 Witnesses, each would produce 1 block every minute.

Other duties include:

* Operate a full node with enough bandwidth to support current network activities. 
* Operate a test version of the blockchain that functions as a public testing environment.
* Sometimes operate an API seed node to support end user applications.
* Integrate, or reject, any changes to the blockchain software that are published. 
* Keep a block producing node running 24/7 every day of the year!

And one unique duty of a Peerplays Witness :

#### BookiePro & Bookie Oracle System \(BOS\)

BookiePro is the world’s first decentralized sports betting exchange application. 

For the app to operate Peerplays Witnesses must also act as decentralized oracles, which means that the Witnesses are required to populate the Peerplays blockchain with real-world sporting data. For example, league and competition data, event data, betting market data for different sports, along with the final scores of each game. It requires approval from a majority of Witnesses for any of this event data to be actioned. 

This process is automated, but sometimes event data from different sources doesn’t agree and if no consensus can be made then it’s the duty of the Witnesses to manually intervene and make proposals to fix the data. Witnesses do this using the Manual Intervention Tool \(MINT\).

Smart contracts then use this data to grade and settle bets placed by users on BookiePro.

### Being a Peerplays Witness is a Paid Job

Blocks are produced every three seconds by Witnesses who take turns signing and validating the blockchain in variable rounds.

As a Peerplays Witnesses you are paid for this duty by the blockchain itself which releases new PPY tokens from the reserve pool, then issues them to the signing Witness after each block is validated.



### Getting Votes to Become a Peerplays Witness



### **Getting started**

**Before we talk about the qualities a witness must have, we first need to discuss nodes and hardware requirements.**  


### **Nodes**

**The following nodes need to be created for both the public mainnet and public testnet:**  


#### **Witness node** 

**is a node run by a witness. Each witness node validates all blocks and transactions it receives. The nodes of elected witnesses take turns in bundling new transactions into** 

#### **API node** 

**provide network services to client applications. They usually have account transaction histories accessible through API calls, but can vary in the amount of available history. Full nodes are API nodes with a complete transaction history of all accounts.**

#### **Seed node \(optional\)**

 **are nodes that accept incoming P2P connections. They are the first nodes contacted by a freshly started node. In that sense they serve as an entry point into the network. Once a node has entered the network it will receive additional node addresses from its peers, so all nodes can connect to each other. A seed node can also be an API node. The BitShares core software, also called witness\_node, comes with a preconfigured list of seed nodes for easy bootstrapping.**

#### **BOS** 

**So depending on whether a witness is running seed nodes or not, between six and eight servers need to be set up.**

### **System Requirements**

**have the qualities to make a great witness: Commitment, accountability, knowledge and reliability.**  


**The job of Peerplays Witness is a paid position, but there aren’t any job interviews or resumés. Instead, to become a Witness you need to convince the Peerplays community \(PPY token holders\) to vote for you. This is often achieved by Witnesses posting information about how they intend to perform their duties as a Witness, and other ways in which they’ll bring value to Peerplays.**

**The Peerplays core wallet makes it easy for PPY holders to vote for witnesses. Anyone who holds PPY can do this by adding the name of the witness to the voting tab. The wallet then sends the information about their votes directly to the Peerplays blockchain. Every few hours, the Peerplays blockchain tallies all the votes from all PPY token holders, and if you are elected as a witness then the blockchain will pay you in PPY tokens for every block that you validate.**

**WHEN DOES THE JOB BEGIN?**

**PPY token holders can begin voting for witnesses immediately after the Peerplays blockchain launches on May 30, 2017.**

**ARE THERE JOB GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES?**

**In Q4 of 2017, the Peerplays blockchain will begin hosting the world’s first decentralized sports betting platform, which is called Bookie. If you are a Peerplays witness at that time you will also be required to manage and settle the hundreds of Sports-betting markets available to users.**

**The job of Peerplays witness is expected to become a full-time position by 2018, with increases in pay to support the greater workload.**  


[**Bookie**](http://bookie.exchange/)**, the decentralized sports betting exchange app for the Peerplays blockchain, requires that Peerplays Witnesses also act as decentralized oracles, which means that the Witnesses are required to populate the Peerplays blockchain with real-world sporting data. For example, league and competition data, event data, betting market data for different sports \(soccer, basketball, football, tennis, etc.\), along with the final scores of each game. Smart contracts then use this data to grade and settle bets placed by users on Bookie.**
