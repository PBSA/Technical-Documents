Investor Guide

.. note:: This guide is still under construction. Please excuse if what you are searching for is not yet available.

The investor guide serves as an entry point for existing and potential investors in the BitShares ecosystem. We here merely discuss the BTS token as well as investment opportunities available within BitShares itself and deliberately do not advertise 3rd party businesses. Please be reminded that this is an information platform and thus we do not give investment advice.


Claim your Investment
==============================

You are considered as a AngelShare holder if you have donated BTC or BTS to one of these addresses:

* **BTC**: ``1ANGELwQwWxMmbdaSWhWLqBEtPTkWb8uDc``
* **PTS**: ``PaNGELmZgzRQCKeEKM6ifgTqNkC4ceiAWw``

There is also an `AngelShare Explorer <http://www1.agsexplorer.com/>`_ specifically for these donations

AngelShares have been gifted 50% of the initial BTS shares. The other 50% went to AngelShares, the other went to holders of PTS.

Claiming your Stake
-----------------------

In order to claim your BTS, you need to look in your bitcoin wallet and search for transactions the the above mentioned address. The keys that correspond to the inputs of that transaction are what you need to obtain your BTS (`FAQ <http://www1.agsexplorer.com/ags101>`_ ).

If you have located the private keys (in wallet import format - WIF), you can safely import them into your BitShares account using the *Import Keys* tools in the Wallet Management Console of your BitShares wallet.
